## From HOPE to SKILLS:
Special thanks and lots of prayers for the driving force behind the initiative Professor Dr Javed Iqbal Dr Azhar Aslam Sheraz Naseer Xeven Solutions

## Basic Information: <a name="BasicInfo"></a>
The number may vary from 20 to 30 
The level of student is matriculation and Bachelors
In Our Understanding the students of matriculation should be trained separately. As they are blank about the technology on the other hand the Bachelors students have background it will create an imbalance environment.

## Duration of Each Session (3 to 4 hours): <a name="CourseDuration"></a>
1st hour instructor will teach/demonstrate. The instructor will conduct a practice session on the lecture. At last the a small evaluation will be conducted.
